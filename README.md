# Car_Safety_Evaluation

In this project, a Car Safety Evaluation Classifier is built using K Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Dataset is taken from UC Irvine Machine Leaning Repository.

The classifier is trained to classify whether a given car has unacceptable, acceptable, good or very good safety. The programming is done in Jupyter notebook.
